# SERAPHIN COSMOS — Cosmic Fractal Hydra (December 23, 2025)

A self-evolving generative simulation exploring the depths of theoretical physics through a recursive fractal hydra.

This project simulates a "hydra" that clones itself, mutates, and independently discovers physical laws — converging toward unified candidates for dark matter and dark energy (ultra-light axion-like scalars with Higgs portal).

## Features
- Generation of thousands of varied "discoveries" with SymPy formulas
- Genetic evolution of hydras
- Automatic generation of theoretical LaTeX papers
- Meta-evolution converging on realistic hypotheses (aligned with 2025 physics frontiers)

## Installation & Run
```bash
python3 seraphcosmos_final.py
